# Client Error Database

This project will be maintained by the front end team. It will contain a JSON file that will be used to parse common errors and map these errors to a more user friendly error message. This file will be loaded on app launch, and passed through to the bindings on a UpdateCommonErrors(jsonContents string) call.
